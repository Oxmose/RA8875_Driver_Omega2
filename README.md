# RA8875_Driver_Omega2 SPI 4-Wire interface

## NON WORKING AT THE MOMENT (the omega has some troubles with SPI)

Porting MBED RA8875 controller drivers to C++ library for Onion Omega2 on SPI interface.
Original code is provided by Mbed and STM32 boards code.

Used code :

Gpio management code : https://github.com/Patryk27/Omega2-GPIO

DigitalOut manager code : https://developer.mbed.org/users/mbed_official/code/mbed-src/file/a11c0372f0ba/api/DigitalOut.h

RA8875 driver lib : https://developer.mbed.org/users/displaymodule/code/dm_ra8875_demo/

The code provided in this repository have been ported to omega 2 architecture.
The code was not originaly written by me, I just ported it.
